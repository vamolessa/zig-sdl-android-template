# a zig sdl android app template

This is a tutorial that will guide you how to build an Android application 'by hand' using
- Zig as the main programming language
- SDL as the platform abstraction
- `zig build` as build automation

We also cover what is the process of creating an apk from scratch. No AndroidStudio required.
Also, the process for creating APKs applies for pretty much any language that can talk C.

Tested on Windows.

# getting started

## requirements
- JDK
    - if you already have AndroidStudio installed, you can simply use the folder `<android-studio>/jre`
    - otherwise, you should install latest openjdk (`scoop install openjdk` should work)
- Android SDK
    - `platforms` (min `16`, latest recommended)
    - `build-tools` with the same number as `platforms`
    - `ndk` (a version that has a `platforms` subfolder as newer versions don't seem to come with?)
    - `cmake` (needed to build SDL)

You can install these components with some commands that look like these (or else use Android Studio to install them):
```
sdkmanager --install "platforms;android-28"
sdkmanager --install "build-tools;28.0.2"
sdkmanager --install "ndk;21.4.7075529"
sdkmanager --install "cmake;3.18.1"

# if not on path, you can invoke sdkmanager as `<android-sdk>/tools/bin/sdkmanager`
```

## project structure
- `android-project`: where all android related files are. including build output
    - `AndroidManifest.xml`: your android app manifest (more info bellow)
    - `java`: java sources that interface with the android os. includes your app's MainActivity
    - `jni`: project files that help build your dependencies (only SDL in this template) for android
    - `keystore`: where you put your keystores. this template assumes that you'll generate a `debug.keystore` here (more info bellow)
    - `res`: your android app resources files
    - `out`: all intermediate and final apk build outputs. you'll find the final apk here (`app.apk`)
    - `ndk-out`: build cache of your dependencies (only SDL in this template)
- `assets`: home of all your game assets
- `src`: zig (game) sources
    - `src/main.zig`: the main application code where assets are loaded, images are displayed on screen and input is processed
    - `src/android_main.zig`: android specific code, like the main function exported to `libmain.so` and also a simple log routing
- `third-party`: your dependencies go here. in this template, there's only SDL2 there
- `zig-libc-configs`: when cross-compiling, zig needs a libc config file that tells it where to find libc related folders (more info bellow)
- `package.bat`: first version of the packaging pipeline. it's still there for easy reference of what's needed to generate an apk. however the real source of truth is `build.zig`
- `build.zig`: general build scripts for this template
- `build_android.zig`: android related build scripts for this template (used by `build.zig`)

## updating SDL
This repository contains the latest SDL release as of writing this, which is `2.0.16`.

Updating SDL is a matter of replacing the contents of the `third-party/SDL2` folder.

Then you have to update the SDL java sources in `android-project/java/org/libsdl/app/*.java`.
For that you can either:
- symlink it to point to `third-party/SDL2/android-project/app/src/main/java/org/libsdl/app`; or
- manually copy those java sources to the destination
    - this repository does the later as I've deleted some unecessary folders from the SDL installation (but you don't need to)

### SDL extensions
If you plan on using any SDL extension (SDL_image, SDL_mixer, etc), it'd be a matter of:
- putting them inside the `third-party` folder
- enabling their loading in your `MainActivity.java` (more info bellow)
- add build steps to also build them for android in `build_android.zig` (similar to how the SDL core is built)
- link to them when building your zig main library in `build.zig` (similar to how we already link to the SDL core lib)

## things to change/setup for your project
- `build.zig`
    - edit the `android.installAndRunApkStep(...)` call to pass it the correct package name and main activity class name
- `zig-libc-configs`
    - this folder contains libc configs for each android target
    - NOTE: whenever you change any sdk related info (SDK, NDK or platform versions, etc), please remove the `zig-libc-configs` folder for it to be regenerated!
    - it is autogenerated whenever `zig build` is invoked. in future versions of zig it will be possible to generate it as a build step
- `android-project/AndroidManifest.xml`
    - package name in `manifest.package` (default: `com.gamemaker.game`)
    - any custom permission/user feature you'd like to add/remove (you can check out other manifests or even the one included with SDL)
    - main activity class name in `manifest/application/activity.android:name` (default: `MainActivity`)
- `android-project/res/values/strings.xml`
    - app name
- `android-project/java/com/gamemaker/game/MainActivity.java`
    - java package (default: `com.gamemaker.game`).
        - NOTE: do not forget to also rename the folder struct to reflect the package name!
    - change your zig main function name (default: `SDL_main`)
    - change loaded native libraries (mainly if you use any SDL extension or other native libs)
    - override any other default property from `android-project/java/org/libsdl/app/SDLActivity.java`
- `assets` folder
    - this template sets the `assets` folder up for any asset your project might use (images, audios, fonts, etc)
        - should be easy to change it to something else
        - but it's easier (only way?) to package the apk when everything is under a single folder

### generate keystore
Use `keytool` that comes in JDK to generate your keystores.
This template assumes the keystore file `android-project/keystore/debug.keystore` with `password` as its password.
You can generate this file yourself with these commands:

```
cd android-project
mkdir keystore
cd keystore
<JDK_PATH>/bin/keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -alias debugkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

When submitting your app to a store, you'll want to also generate (and backup!) a `release.keystore`.

### first build
When doing the first apk build, you'll want to do things in this order:
- generate debug keystore
- `zig build sdl-android`
- `zig build apk`

That is because generating the keystore is an interactive process.
Also, the `apk` step does not depend on `sdl-android` because even with caching, running `zig build sdl-android` takes
a few seconds. Since it's a step that you'd re-run very rarely, I think it's fine to keep it separated.

The following apk builds should be just a matter of repeating `zig build apk`
and then testing the generated apk on a device or emulator.

# steps to create an apk
Here is an overview of all the steps needed to create a working apk that uses native code:

- compile all dependencies targeting android
    - for SDL this means invoking `ndk-build` that uses the `Application.mk` and `Android.mk` to generate its native libs
- compile your code targeting android linking against those dependencies artifacts
    - for zig, we do this inside `build.zig`
- generate `R.java` inside the `out` folder by invoking `aapt` found in Android SDK build-tools folder
- compile any java code using `javac` that comes with the JDK
    - using the `android.jar` found in the Android SDK as `-classpath`;
    - targeting java `7` by passing `1.7` to both `-target` and `-source`; and
    - passing the `java:out` argument kinda means that we're taking java source from the `java` folder and outputing the compiled code to the `out` folder
- convert the compiled java code to Android VM compatible bytecode by using `dx` also in the Android SDK build-tools folder
    - we pass it `--min-sdk-version=16` which is the minimum required for an application to load native code (from what I understand)
    - it will generate a `classes.dex` in the `out` folder
- create the first version of out apk by calling `aapt` again
    - we actually generate a `app.apk.unaligned` to make it clear that it is not final
    - it's also here where we push the `assets` folder into the apk
- call `aapt add` to add the `classes.dex` converted previously into the apk
    - as a quirk, the path inside the apk an added file has is *exactly* the same as the argument passed to the command
    - because of this, we must invoke the tool from a folder where it lets us pass the file as an argument with the correct path
        - that is, in the case of `classes.dex`, we must change to the folder containing the file since `classes.dex` must reside in the root of the apk
- call `aapt add` for every native library we previously built for android
    - all lib files must be inside a `lib` folder
    - even further, it must be inside a `lib/<target>` folder where `<target>` means the target the lib was compiled against
    - for example, if you build your `libmain.so` for `arm64-v8a` which is a pretty common android target, the final path inside the apk must be `lib\arm64-v8a\libmain.so`
- sign the apk using `jarsigner` found in the JDK
    - NOTE: you must provide a previously created keystore and its password for it to work
    - please refer to the previous `### generate keystore` section
- align the apk using `zipalign` found in the Android SDK build-tools folder
    - note that we pass the final file name to the command which is finally `app.apk`, our ready to be installed apk!
- finally you can send it to your device using `adb install` found in the Android SDK `platform-tools` folder
    - please refer to the `## installing` section bellow

# testing the app
## installing
```
<android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb install -r android-project/out/app.apk
```

## uninstalling
```
<android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb uninstall com.gamemaker.game
```
NOTE: change `com.gamemaker.game` with your app package name.

## device logs
```
<android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb logcat -s SDL SDL/APP
```

NOTE: it's also possible to filter logs by doing something like this:
```
<android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb logcat | grep com.gamemaker.game
```

## running
```
<android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb shell am start -n com.gamemaker.game/com.gamemaker.game.MainActivity
```
Where `com.gamemaker.game` should be your app's package name and `MainActivity` should be the name
of the MainActivity class of your app.

### using zig build
It's also possible to install and run using `zig build` with:
```
zig build run-apk
```
Remember to edit your `build.zig` to match your final package name and main activity class name!
